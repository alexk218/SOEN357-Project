# SOEN357-Project
## Running the Project
There are two primary ways to run this project:

#### 1. Serving via a Local HTTP Server:
If you have Python installed, you can quickly start a local server.

**Open Terminal or Command Prompt:**
- Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
- macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal application.
**Navigate to the Project Directory:**
`cd path/to/your/project/directory`
**Start the HTTP Server:**
`python -m http.server 8000`
This command starts a local server on port 8000. You can choose a different port if 8000 is in use.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

#### 2. Using Live Server Extension (VSCode):
If you're using VSCode, use the Live Server extension to launch a local server.
If not already installed, install the extension.
Right-click on the index.html file (or any other HTML file) in the Explorer panel.
Select Open with Live Server.
